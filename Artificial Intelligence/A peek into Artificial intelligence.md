This entry is mostly from the perspective of learning the basic concepts involved in today's buzz words Artificial intelligence and machine learning. In here we cover some key landmarks in evolution of AI/ML which led to the modern view of ChatGPT or similar applications also known as Large language models by navigating through a little bit of peer review papers, math and programs using PyTorch. The goal is not to approach the subject theoretically rather intuitively using basic math and simple programs.

Artificial intelligence as the name suggests is defined by ability of machines to perform activities like logical reasoning, problem-solving, decision making. This is pretty wide term encompassing machine learning, deep leaning and natural language processing etc.

A hierarchical representation of the terminologies that are important to our discussion is as below
 1. Artificial intelligence : Defined above
	 1. Machine leaning : A branch of artificial intelligence, which is concerned with teaching computers from a set of data.
		 1. Neural networks : A neural network consists of layers of neurons that mimics the human neurons put together to process and analyze data.
			 1. Deep Neural networks : These are subset of neural network consisting of multiple many layers of neuron accomplishing a sophisticated task. Some examples of deep learning models include CNN, RNN, GAN etc.
				 1. Generative AI : Generative AI uses DNN as building blocks to create or generate image (Midjourney) , text (ChatGPT) etc. 
					 1. LLM (Large language models): A type of generative AI specifically designed for text data like GPT (Generated Pre-trained) developed by OpenAI.

It should be understood that the AI is not just ChatGPT or vice versa. Although most popular ChatGPT is just a  subset of large space covered by AI.

LLMs have become by far the most popular applications on internet today as their numerous applications are being invented/discovered daily. The whole technology space is evolving rapidly by the application of LLMs. To build an good understanding of how LLMs work, one should start from understanding DNNs at the very least.
